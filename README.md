## Features

- Scans ports from 1 to 1024.
- Identifies open ports on the target device.
- Measures the time taken for the scan.
- Easy to modify and extend.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `socket` module (included in the Python standard library)

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the script file.

## Usage

To run the script, simply execute the file in your terminal:

```bash
python3 port_scanner.py
```
Parameters

    target: IP address or hostname of the device you want to scan (e.g., 127.0.0.1).
    ports: Range of ports to scan (currently set to scan from 1 to 1024).

Usage Example

When you run the script, it will prompt you for the IP address or hostname to scan. An example output might look like this:

```
Enter the IP address or hostname to scan: 127.0.0.1
Scanning 127.0.0.1 for open ports...

Open ports:
Port 22 is open.
Port 80 is open.

Scanning completed in 3.45 seconds.
